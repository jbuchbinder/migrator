# MIGRATOR CLI

This provides a command-line utility using the [migrator library](https://github.com/jbuchbinder/migrator) which allows data to be "migrated" from one database to another. This is superior to traditional MySQL replication in that source db table rows can be removed without the deletions being replicated across.
